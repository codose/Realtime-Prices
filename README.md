## Gradle Setup üêò

This project is using [**Gradle Kotlin DSL**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) as well as the [Plugin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block) to setup the build.

Dependencies are centralized inside the [buildSrc](buildSrc/src/main/java) folder. This provides convenient auto-completion when writing your gradle files.

## How To Build
Pull the code on this branch, import into Android Studio, from there you can run it like a standard
android project project or run ./gradlew assembleDebug. Further notes can be found here https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline#DebugMode
